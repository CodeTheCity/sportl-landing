	We have a ton! Of really exciting features to add in the coming months!
</p>

<p class="message">
	-We're going to let you search for new people to play in any sport you like!
	We'll even filter them for you based on your skills and location!
	(Also the sport you play... But I felt that was a given... pedants)
	-Next up we're going to add mentors so you can find people to teach you
	a new sport!
	-We the team are also very excited about adding support for user and group profiles.
	-We are planning to make our search function even more awesome
	with filters to cutomize your search and a map to see exactly where you can meet
	and play.
	-We're also going to integrate communication features so you can talk
	anonymously
	-You'll hopefully soon be able to bookmark events you're interested in or regularly
	attend and bookmark someone you think would be a good challenge on the court or
	you just had a great game with them!
	-On a similar note we hope to add a note to let you know who you've already played!
	
	THE FURTHER FUTURE!!!
	
	-We will create Mentor ranking systems and verification of qualifications
	for coaches and personal trainers.
	-We'll handle the booking of your court or session for you!
	No awkward run to the cash machine and gum purchase at the nearest
	shop so you have change. We'll let you pay for everything through the site!
	
	-We're dreaming of making a box league where competitive people
	can play each other and get satisfaction as they climb up the ranks
	and divisions! Even if it takes you 1 hour to run a 100 meters
	there'll be a league for you!
	We're planning leagues for every ability.
	We also will handle all the matchmaking and roombooking!
	You'll just have to agree to play!
	
	-Android and iOS apps
